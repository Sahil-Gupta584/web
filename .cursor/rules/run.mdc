## Docker Development Environment

### Default Assumption
- **Project is always running** via Docker containers
- **Services are available** and properly configured
- **No need to start/stop** services for each task

### Available Environments
- **Development**: `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **QA**: `docker-compose.qa.yml` 
- **Production**: `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- **Self-hosted**: `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml`

### When NOT to Run Commands
- ❌ Don't run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- ❌ Don't run `npm start` or development servers
- ❌ Don't build the project unless specifically requested
- ❌ Don't restart services unless there's an error

### When Commands ARE Needed
- ✅ Database migrations or schema changes
- ✅ Specific debugging or troubleshooting
- ✅ User explicitly requests build/restart
- ✅ Adding new dependencies (but assume they'll handle container restart)

### Examples
```bash
# ❌ Avoid - services already running
npm run dev
docker-compose up

# ✅ OK - specific requests
docker-compose exec web npm run migrate
docker-compose logs web
```
